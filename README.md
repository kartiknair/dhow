This is a rewrite of [kartiknair/dhow](https://github.com/kartiknair/dhow), written because I ran into some issues that were hard to debug and was missing some features.

From the original `README`:

>JSX-powered SSG for Node.js. Write logic like React with a directory-structure like Next.js but generate plain HTML with no client side JS.
